<p>
I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.chaac.tf.fau.eu" target="_blank">Chair of Applied Cryptography</a> research group at <a href="https://www.fau.eu" target="_blank">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</a> in Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.dominique-schroeder.de" target="_blank">Dominique Schröder</a>.

I use formal methods to advance cryptographic constructions and protocols, ensuring that rigorous theory translates into practical, efficient, and secure systems.
My work involves formalizing cryptographic primitives, constructions, protocols, and definitions, as well as exploring the theoretical relationships between them.
My goal is to build upon these theoretical insights to enhance efficiency and strengthen security guarantees in real-world cryptographic applications.

I am pursuing my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.dominique-schroeder.de"target="_blank">Dominique Schröder</a> since 2023.
Prior to my PhD, I earned a Master of Science (M.Sc.) and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.fau.eu" target="_blank">Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg</a> between 2016 and 2023.
